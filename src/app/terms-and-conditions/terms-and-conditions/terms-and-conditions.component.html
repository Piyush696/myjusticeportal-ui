        For inmates (“Users”), My Justice Portal, LLC provides an online legal portal, providing users a platform to
        create notes, utilize automated legal documents, a means to find helpful third party services, and a way to
        communicate with their attorney or attorneys. Users need not download or even license My Justice Portal, LLC

        At no time do we review your answers for legal sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, provide legal advice,

    <p>11. <b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION</b></p>
    <p>Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.</p>
    <p> Summary: </p>
    <p>
        Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our Customer Care
        Center at (855) 243-8657.
        <b>
            In the unlikely event that the My Justice Portal, LLC, Customer Care Center is unable
            to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if My Justice Portal, LLC has not been able to resolve a
            dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes
            through
            binding arbitration or in small claims court rather than in a court of general jurisdiction.
        </b>
        Arbitration is less
        formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for
        more limited discovery than a court does, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
        <b>
            Any arbitration under
            these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
        </b>
        While in some instances, upfront costs to file an arbitration claim may exceed similar costs to bring a
        case in
        court, for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, My Justice Portal, LLC will pay all costs of
        the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you may recover attorney's fees from My Justice Portal, LLC to the
        same extent or more as you would in court. The arbitrator shall apply the same limitations period that would
        apply in court.

    </p>
    <p>
        Under certain circumstances (as explained below), My Justice Portal, LLC will pay you more than the amount of
        the
        arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorney's fees if the arbitrator
        awards you an amount greater than what My Justice Portal, LLC offered you to settle the dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may speak with independent counsel before using this Platform.

    </p>
    <p><b>Arbitration Agreement:</b></p>
    <p>
        (a) My Justice Portal, LLC and you agree to arbitrate <b>all disputes and claims</b> between us before a single
        arbitrator.
        The types of disputes and claims we agree to arbitrate are intended to be broadly interpreted. It applies,
        without
        limitation, to:
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <p>
                ● claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in
                contract,
                tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory;

            </p>
            <p>
                ● claims that arose before these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to
                advertising);

            </p>
            <p>
                ● claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a
                member
                of a certified class; and

            </p>
            <p>
                ● claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
            </p>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to " My Justice Portal, LLC," "you," and "us" include
        our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, employers, business partners, shareholders,
        predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or
        beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms or any prior agreements between us. Beneficiaries
        include, but are not limited to, those named in an estate planning document.

    </p>
    <p>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This
        arbitration agreement does not preclude your bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local
        agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
        <b>
            You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and My Justice Portal, LLC are each waiving the right to a
            trial by jury or to
            participate in a class action.
        </b>
        These Terms evidence a transaction or website use in interstate commerce, and
        thus the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This
        arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.

    </p>
    <p>
        (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send, by U.S. certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
        ("Notice") to the other party. A Notice to My Justice Portal, LLC should be addressed to: Notice of Dispute,
        General Counsel, My Justice Portal, LLC, 11 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA 30000 (the "Notice Address"). The
        Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief
        sought ("Demand"). If My Justice Portal, LLC and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30
        days after the Notice is received, you or My Justice Portal, LLC may commence an arbitration proceeding. During
        the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by My Justice Portal, LLC or you shall not be disclosed
        to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or My Justice Portal,
        LLC is entitled.

    </p>
    <p>
        You may download or copy a form to initiate arbitration from the American Arbitration Association ("the AAA")
        website at <a href="https://www.adr.org">https://www.adr.org</a>.

    </p>
    <p>
        (c) After My Justice Portal, LLC receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it
        will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $75,000.
        (Currently, the filing fee for consumer-initiated arbitrations is $200, but this is subject to change by the
        arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, My Justice Portal, LLC will pay it directly after
        receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration
        Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by these Terms, for all claims
        under $75,000, and the applicable rules as determined by the AAA for all claims of or above $75,000, and will be
        administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at <a href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by
        calling the AAA at
        1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that
        issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of the arbitration provision and the scope,
        enforceability, and interpretation of paragraph (f) are for the court to decide. Unless My Justice Portal, LLC
        and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your contact
        address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely
        on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
        established by the AAA Rules. If you choose to proceed either in person or by telephone, we may choose to
        respond only by telephone or submission. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the AAA Rules will determine whether you
        have a right to a hearing. The parties agree that in any arbitration of a dispute or claim, neither party will
        rely for preclusive effect on any award or finding of fact or conclusion of law made in any other arbitration of
        any dispute or claim to which My Justice Portal, LLC was a party. Except as otherwise provided for herein, My
        Justice Portal, LLC will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated
        in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of
        your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by
        the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be
        governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse My Justice Portal, LLC for all monies previously
        disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an
        arbitration in which you seek relief valued at more than $75,000 (excluding attorney’s fees and expenses), the
        payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

    </p>
    <p>
        (d) For claims under $75,000, if, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the
        arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of My Justice Portal, LLC's last written
        settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then My Justice Portal, LLC will:

    </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <p>
                ● pay you either the amount of the award or $2,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater;
                and

            </p>
            <p>
                ● pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney's fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert
                witness
                fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your
                claim in
                arbitration (the "attorney's payment").

            </p>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        If My Justice Portal, LLC did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected,
        you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney's fees, respectively,
        if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as
        to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney's fees at any
        time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on
        the merits. In assessing whether an award that includes attorney’s fees or expenses is greater than the value of
        My Justice Portal, LLC’s last written settlement offer, the arbitrator shall include in his or her calculations
        only the value of any attorney’s fees or expenses you reasonably incurred in connection with the arbitration
        proceeding before My Justice Portal, LLC’s settlement offer.

    </p>
    <p>
        (e) The right to attorney's fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorney's
        fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under
        applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may
        not recover duplicative awards of attorney's fees or costs. Under some laws My Justice Portal, LLC may have a
        right to an award of attorney's fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration proceeding.

    </p>
    <p>
        (f) The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to
        the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND My Justice Portal,
        LLC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT AS
        PLAINTIFFS OR CLASS MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR IN THE CAPACITY OF A PRIVATE
        ATTORNEY GENERAL. Further, unless both you and My Justice Portal, LLC agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
        consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or
        class proceeding. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award that is individualized to the
        claimant and would not affect other Users. Neither you nor we may seek non-individualized relief that would
        affect other Users. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's
        limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the
        arbitration and may be brought in court.

    </p>
    <p>
        (g) If the amount in dispute exceeds $75,000 or either party seeks any form of injunctive relief, either party
        may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by AAA by a written notice of appeal within thirty
        (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. An award of injunctive relief shall be stayed
        during any such appeal. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to AAA rules. The
        three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the
        appealing party's notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding,
        subject to any right of judicial review that exists under the FAA.

    </p>
    <p>
        (h) Notwithstanding any provision in the applicable Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future
        change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to any notice address, website link or telephone
        number provided herein), that change will not apply to any dispute of which we had written notice on the
        effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this arbitration provision, any such termination
        will not be effective until at least thirty (30) days after written notice of such termination is provided to
        you, and shall not be effective as to disputes which arose prior to the date of termination.
